I am Hicham Hammouchi a PhD candidate in Machine Learning and Cybersecurity at [ENSIAS](http://ensias.um5.ac.ma/), [Mohamed 5 University of Rabat](http://www.um5.ac.ma/um5/) in co-direction with the [International University of Rabat](https://www.uir.ac.ma/). I am working on  modeling and predicting socio-technical cyber threats, precisely building predictive models that can understand how contextual aspects and socio-technical dimensions of cyber attacks interact with each other. My [research](publications) explores the interplay between social, political and economic events and the technical aspects of cyber attacks, and how social insights can improve the predictability of these threats using social media crowdsourcing, time series forecasting and machine learning. My research was funded by [Nato Science for Peace and Security programme](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/78209.htm) within [ThreatPredict project](https://threatpredict.inria.fr/) (2017-2020)

I have [teaching](teaching) experience in Deep Learning and computer architecture at the International University of Rabat.
