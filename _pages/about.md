Welcome! I am Hicham Hammouchi a PhD candidate in Machine Learning and Cybersecurity at [ENSIAS](http://ensias.um5.ac.ma/), [Mohamed 5 University of Rabat](http://www.um5.ac.ma/um5/) in co-direction with the [International University of Rabat](https://www.uir.ac.ma/). I am interested in modeling and predicting socio-technical cyber threats, precisely in understanding how contextual aspects and socio-technical dimensions of cyber attacks interact with each other, and build predictive models to serve as warning system for individuals and organizations. In my [research](publications) I use time series forecasting, tabular data modeling and prediction, and graph-based methods for threats characterization.
